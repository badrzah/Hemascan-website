## 📦 S3 + CloudFront - Alternative

### When to Choose S3 + CloudFront?

Only choose this if you:
- Need maximum control over CDN settings
- Want to minimize costs at very high scale
- Don't want Git integration
- Need custom CloudFront behaviors
- Already have infrastructure expertise

### Setup Steps (30+ minutes)

1. Create S3 bucket
2. Configure bucket for static hosting
3. Set bucket policies
4. Build your app: `npm run build`
5. Upload to S3: `aws s3 sync build/ s3://bucket-name`
6. Create CloudFront distribution
7. Configure CloudFront origin
8. Set up error pages (403 → 200 → /index.html for React Router)
9. Configure SSL certificate (requires manual request)
10. Set up DNS records
11. Wait for CloudFront deployment (~15 minutes)
12. Configure cache invalidation

### Challenges

- ❌ React Router requires manual error page configuration
- ❌ No automatic deployments (need CI/CD setup)
- ❌ SSL certificate setup is manual
- ❌ More configuration files needed
- ❌ Cache invalidation required after each deploy

### Cost
- **S3**: ~$0.023/GB storage + $0.005/1000 requests
- **CloudFront**: ~$0.085/GB data transfer (first 10TB)
- **Total**: ~$1-10/month for low-medium traffic

## 🎯 Final Recommendation

### **Use AWS Amplify** ✅

**Perfect for your medical application because:**
- ✅ Quick to deploy and iterate
- ✅ Automatic HTTPS (critical for medical apps)

### Use S3 + CloudFront only if:
